<!-- mpl-go by NewForester:  programming notes on and examples in Go -->

<h1 id="go-refresher-notes">Go Refresher Notes</h1>
<p>Anyone can remember things they use everyday but it is not everyday one reinstalls a programming language. No matter how well one knows a programming language, some details fade if one spends any length of time using another.</p>
<p>Below is not a Go tutorial but quick refresher notes. Hopefully just enough to bring back all you do know that has slipped just beyond the instant recall threshold.</p>
<p>Do not forget to update these notes with what you have learnt since they were written.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golang">Go</a> is modern programming language developed by Google that first appeared towards the end of 2009.</p>
<p>Go is a compiled language that follows the structured / imperative paradigm. The language is strongly and statically typed but features type inference and structural typing. Memory management is based on garbage collection.</p>
<p>Go features concurrency: the implementation of true coroutines is perhaps its defining characteristic.</p>
<p>The current stable release is 1.10.1 (released March 28 2018).</p>
<p>Go, its compiler and tools are free and open source and available under a modified BSD licences.</p>
<p>Go seeks to improve on C/C++ with a feature set that emphasises:</p>
<ul>
<li>small (enough to keep in one's head as in C)</li>
<li>syntactic conciseness (more common in dynamic languages);</li>
<li>fast compilation times;</li>
<li>statically linked, standalone binaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go deliberately omits featuers common in other languages leading to criticisms. The use of garbage collection introduces pauses that limit the language's use for systems programming and for hard real-time applications.</p>
<p>Go is not a class-based object oriented language but provides 'interfaces' instead that are similar to 'prototypes' in Java or abstract base classes in C++.</p>
<p>Go has a package system that includes remote management and online documentation but it is not as complete as those of Rust or Node.js since there is no central repository.</p>
<p>Go comes with language tools that encourage a consistent approach to many tasks, including code formatting.</p>
<p>The official web-site is <a href="golang.org">https://golang.org/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="installation-upgrade-removal">Installation, Upgrade, Removal</h2>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Go is available from Debian repositories but is inevitably an out of date version. Best to install the latest stable (binary) version from the Go project.</p>
<h4 id="officially">Officially</h4>
<p>For *nix systems, download the appropriate tar-ball, then unpack:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ <span class="kw">sudo</span> <span class="kw">tar</span> -C /usr/local -xzf go1.10.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code></pre>
<p>You are left to alter your PATH to include <em>/usr/local/go/bin</em>.</p>
<p>The tar-ball is the order of 110 Mb and the final install 350 Mb.</p>
<h4 id="alternatively">Alternatively</h4>
<p>If you are installing language tools on another volume:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ <span class="kw">mkdir</span> /media/work/lang/go;
    $ <span class="kw">sudo</span> <span class="kw">ln</span> -s /media/work/lang/go/ /usr/local;

    $ <span class="kw">tar</span> -C /usr/local -xzf go1.10.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz</code></pre>
<h4 id="binaries">Binaries</h4>
<p>You do not need to alter your PATH if <em>/usr/local/bin</em> is already on it:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    $ <span class="kw">sudo</span> <span class="kw">ln</span> -s /usr/local/go/bin/* /usr/local/bin;</code></pre>
<p>There are only three binaries.</p>
<h3 id="upgrade">Upgrade</h3>
<p>The instructions state to delete your current installation and install the upgrade as for a new installation.</p>
<h3 id="removal">Removal</h3>
<p>It a simple as deleteing the top directory:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    <span class="kw">rm</span> -r /usr/local/go</code></pre>
<p>and/or:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">    <span class="kw">rm</span> -r /media/work/lang/go</code></pre>
<p>Do not forget to tidy your PATH.</p>
<h2 id="platform-documentation">Platform Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="online">Online</h3>
<p>Is too early to comment on the standard and style of Go documentation online. I enjoyed the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/">Tour of Go</a> but found the standard library documentation overwhelming.</p>
<p>The Go Project documentation is available here: <a href="https://golang.org/doc/">golang.org/doc</a>. This appears to be an index for all project documentation covering a wide range of topics.</p>
<p>The standard library documentation is under <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/">https://golang.org/pkg/</a> but I expect other packages are documented elsewhere.</p>
<p>There are references to other resources that may help find packages and their documentation that are not in the standard library.</p>
<h3 id="offline">Offline</h3>
<p>The tool for this is <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc">godoc</a>, which is installed by default. The tool is Swiss Army Knife: not all features are described here.</p>
<p>Go documentation for commands and libraries is generated directly from the source code. The library used by <code>godoc</code> will generate either plain text or hhml.</p>
<p>Thus the tool can be used from the command line to generate documentation in man page style. It can also be run as a local web-server and documentation accessed using a browser.</p>
<p>Documentation for any installed command or library (including your own) can be generated without Internet access.</p>
<p>The tool will also access the Internet (without asking permission). By default it will access the Go Project servers and so Go Project documentation but you can point it elsewhere to access documentation for other Go based projects without having to install the pertinent packages.</p>
<h2 id="learning-materials">Learning Materials</h2>
<p>I have not seen a definitive 'Go Book'.</p>
<p>A good place to start is the <a href="tour.golang.org/welcome/1">The Tour of Go</a> and good for dipping into is <a href="https://gobyexample.com">Go by Example</a>.</p>
<p>There is a list of Go tutorials (etc.) on <a href="https://hackr.io/tutorials/learn-golang">hackr.io</a> of which <a href="https://hackr.io/tutorial/the-little-go-book">The Little Go Book</a> and <a href="https://hackr.io/tutorial/an-introduction-to-programming-in-go">An Introduction to Programming in Go</a> have good titles.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Go">Go Wikibook</a>.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/cdarwin/go-koans">Go Koans</a> on GitHub. These appears to cover a good number of topics. The respository dates from 2015 and the most recent commit was 2018 Q1.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://exercism.io/languages/go/about">Exercism Go Track</a> has 105 exercises.</p>
