<h1 id="go-refresher-notes">Go Refresher Notes</h1>
<p>Anyone can remember things they use everyday but it is not everyday one reinstalls a programming language. No matter how well one knows a programming language, some details fade if one spends any length of time using another.</p>
<p>Below is not a Go tutorial but quick refresher notes. Hopefully just enough to bring back all you do know that has slipped just beyond the instant recall threshold.</p>
<p>Do not forget to update these notes with what you have learnt since they were written.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golang">Go</a> is modern programming language developed by Google that first appeared towards the end of 2009.</p>
<p>Go is a compiled language that follows the structured / imperative paradigm. The language is strongly and statically typed but features type inference and structural typing. Memory management is based on garbage collection.</p>
<p>Go features concurrency: the implementation of true coroutines is perhaps its defining characteristic.</p>
<p>The current stable release is 1.10.1 (released March 28 2018).</p>
<p>Go, its compiler and tools are free and open source and available under a modified BSD licences.</p>
<p>Go seeks to improve on C/C++ with a feature set that emphasises:</p>
<ul>
<li>small (enough to keep in one's head as in C)</li>
<li>syntactic conciseness (more common in dynamic languages);</li>
<li>fast compilation times;</li>
<li>statically linked, standalone binaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go deliberately omits featuers common in other languages leading to criticisms. The use of garbage collection introduces pauses that limit the language's use for systems programming and for hard real-time applications.</p>
<p>Go is not a class-based object oriented language but provides 'interfaces' instead that are similar to 'prototypes' in Java or abstract base classes in C++.</p>
<p>Go has a package system that includes remote management and online documentation but it is not as complete as those of Rust or Node.js since there is no central repository.</p>
<p>Go comes with language tools that encourage a consistent approach to many tasks, including code formatting.</p>
<p>The official web-site is <a href="golang.org">https://golang.org/</a>.</p>
