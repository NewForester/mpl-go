<!-- mpl-go by NewForester:  programming notes on and examples in Go -->

# MPL Go

This repository contains:

  * notes made while studying Go tutorial(s);
  * exercises and examples from the tutorial(s);
  * solutions to exercises on the [Exercism](http://exercism.io/languages/go/about) and similar web sites;
  * any other Go notes, exercises and examples of my own devising.

The study resulted from a desire to understand better some of the modern programming languages developed during the
early years of the 21st century and the advantages they have for software systems development.

The notes and exercises are not a management investigation into why an organisation should use Go
but a technical investigation into what you would need to understand in order to begin programming in Go.

While the material here is my own, it owes a great deal to the tutorial(s) and the Exercism project.

For more detailed and pragmatic notes on Rust, its installation and the facilities it offers,
see [md/Go Refresher.md](md/Go Refresher.md) (or [html/Go Refresher.html](html/Go Refresher.html)).
